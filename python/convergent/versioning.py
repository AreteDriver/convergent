"""
Graph versioning — snapshots, branching, and merging.

Supports point-in-time snapshots for deterministic replay, branching
for speculative work, and merging with conflict detection.

Versioning rules (part of the formal contract):
  - Snapshots are immutable captures of the full graph state.
  - Branches are independent copies that evolve separately.
  - Merging replays the branch's new intents into the target,
    running resolution on each to detect conflicts.
  - Content hashes enable verification of deterministic replay.
